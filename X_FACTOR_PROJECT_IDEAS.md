# 🚀 X-Factor AI Engineering Project Ideas

> Status update (2026-10-08): these are historical portfolio ideas, not implemented AgentPay capabilities or verified outcomes. AgentPay now focuses on business-controlled purchasing, durable orchestration, and payment correctness. Its active scope and six-phase roadmap are in [PRD.md](PRD.md) and [PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md](PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md). Prioritize transaction reliability and business tradeoffs rather than duplicating the resume's guardrail/RAG projects.

> **Tailored for:** Kaushik Mukherjee  
> **Target Roles:** AI Engineer, Agentic Systems Engineer, LLMOps / Inference Engineer  
> **Core Objective:** Stand out against standard API-wrapper candidates by showcasing **fine-tuning (QLoRA)**, **vLLM inference engineering**, **modern protocols (MCP / A2A)**, and **hard systems latency/cost metrics**.

## 1. Executive Diagnosis: What Recruiters Look For

Your profile already possesses strong multi-agent state management (`LangGraph`), deterministic evaluation metrics (`Recall@K`, `MRR`, `nDCG`), and full-stack integration (`FastAPI`, `Docker`, `React`).

To make your resume impossible to ignore, your projects must answer three questions:
1. **Can you do more than API calls?** Show model adaptation via fine-tuning (QLoRA/PEFT) on open-weight SLMs.
2. **Can you engineer for latency, cost, and scale?** Show measured p95/p99 latency, VRAM budgets, quantization (AWQ/GGUF), and continuous batching with vLLM.
3. **Are you building for modern 2025–2026 standards?** Native Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers/clients, autonomous agent-to-agent negotiations, and zero-trust guardrails.

## Option 1 (AI Security, Fine-Tuning & Inference Engineering)
### 🛡️ GuardRail-Zero: Sub-15ms Self-Hosted SLM Firewall & MCP Security Gateway

> **One-Line Pitch:** A custom fine-tuned Small Language Model (0.5B–1.5B parameters) served on vLLM as an ultra-fast, local security proxy that intercepts agent tool calls, blocks indirect prompt injections, and masks PII before payloads hit upstream LLMs.

#### The Industry Problem
Enterprise AI agents interacting with web tools, databases, and APIs are exposed to **indirect prompt injection** and data leakage. Evaluating safety via commercial APIs (e.g., GPT-4o) adds **500ms–1500ms of latency** and thousands of dollars in monthly token overhead. Organizations require local, deterministic, sub-20ms security boundaries.

## Option 2 (Fintech & Autonomous Protocol Engineering)
### ⚡ AgentPay Nexus: Zero-Trust Autonomous A2A Commerce & Settlement Protocol

> **One-Line Pitch:** An autonomous Agent-to-Agent (A2A) commerce engine implementing NPCI UAP/x402 protocol standards, cryptographic transaction intents, and bounded Razorpay settlement with deterministic rollbacks.

#### The Industry Problem
As autonomous buyer and seller agents emerge, merchants must expose machine-readable protocols (MCP / JSON-LD) to participate in AI-driven commerce. Simultaneously, users demand strict, explainable financial boundaries to prevent unconstrained AI spending and price drift.

#### Technical Architecture

```

#### What You Will Build
1. **Agent Commerce Protocols:**
   - Implement **x402 (HTTP 402 AI Micropayments)** and **MCP tool interfaces** for catalog queries, quote exchanges, and price negotiations.
2. **Cryptographic Safety Rails:**

## Option 3 (High-Throughput Search & Systems Performance)
### 🚀 Speculative-RAG: Sub-50ms Hybrid Retrieval & Semantic Routing Engine

> **One-Line Pitch:** A high-throughput, low-latency RAG engine that uses late-chunking, distilled semantic routing, and speculative drafting to cut p95 RAG latency by >60%.

#### The Industry Problem
Standard enterprise RAG pipelines incur 1.5 to 3 seconds of latency per request because they perform vector searches, cross-encoder reranking, and full-context generation unconditionally—even when 30–40% of queries are semantically cached or do not require document retrieval.

#### Technical Architecture

                                Draft SLM (1B) ──► Target LLM (8B)
```

#### What You Will Build
1. **Distilled Semantic Router:**
   - Train a lightweight classifier or fine-tune an embedding model to triage requests in <5ms: *Direct Answer*, *Cache Hit*, or *Deep Retrieval*.
2. **Late-Chunking & Hybrid Search:**
   - Implement late-chunking using transformer token embeddings to preserve global document context across chunk splits.
   - Combine dense embeddings with BM25 sparse indexing inside Qdrant.
3. **Speculative Generation / Verification:**
   - Pair a small draft SLM (e.g., 1B parameters) with a larger target model (8B parameters) to accelerate Time-To-First-Token (TTFT).
4. **Empirical Benchmarks:**
   - Load-test via Locust/k6 to document requests per second (RPS), p95 latency, and RAGAS evaluation metrics (faithfulness, answer relevancy).

#### Resume Impact (Bullet Points for Your CV)
- *Built a high-throughput RAG engine integrating **late-chunking embeddings** and **Qdrant HNSW hybrid search**, cutting context loss across document boundaries.*
- *Designed a sub-5ms **semantic routing classifier** and semantic caching layer, reducing unnecessary vector lookups by 38% and lowering average query latency from 1.8s to 240ms.*
- *Conducted automated regression testing using **RAGAS** and load testing via Locust, documenting latency and token cost reductions in an open benchmark report.*
